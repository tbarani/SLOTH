/**
 * @brief Build N SpatialDiscretization<T, DIM> objects sharing the same mesh,
 *        returned directly as a `SPAS`-compatible `std::vector<SpatialDiscretization<T, DIM>*>`:
 *        the first one is built by forwarding `args...` verbatim to whichever
 *        `SpatialDiscretization<T, DIM>` constructor they match - any of the
 *        four (mesh-file, inline-mesh, periodic inline-mesh, or
 *        existing-mesh overloads) - and the remaining N-1 share that first
 *        one's mesh, exactly like building `spatial_phi1`, `spatial_phi2`,
 *        ... from `spatial_phi0.get_mesh()` by hand.
 *
 *
 * @tparam T Finite element collection type. Must be given explicitly.
 * @tparam DIM Spatial dimension. Must be given explicitly.
 * @tparam Args Deduced argument types, forwarded as-is to the
 *             `SpatialDiscretization<T, DIM>` constructor used to build the
 *             first element.
 * @param N Total number of SpatialDiscretization objects to build (must be
 *          >= 1). The first is built from `args...`, the remaining N-1
 *          share its mesh.
 * @param shared_is_periodic Value passed as `is_periodic_mesh` to the N-1
 *                           mesh-sharing elements. Unused when N == 1.
 * @param args Arguments forwarded verbatim to the `SpatialDiscretization<T, DIM>`
 *            constructor used for the first element.
 * @return std::vector<SpatialDiscretization<T, DIM>*> of size N, owned by
 *         the caller - release with `deleteSpatialDiscretization`.
